Hey Dailies! 
This is something totally new I was supposed to walk more about my daily life but today I'm switching it up a bit. I'm sure many of you guys are having the same issue as me which is working and going to school. Please never drop ou school unless its necessary( i still say you shouldn't) but working can be fun and it is not the working im talking about but more about making the money, I'm not going to lie I love money but not as much as a bright future. Ill talks a little more about this on my next blog. Stay in school dailies.
