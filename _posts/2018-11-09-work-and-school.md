Hey Dailies! 
This is something totally new i was supposed to walk more about my daily life but today im switching it up a bit. I'm sure many of you guys are having the same issue as me which is working and going to school. Please never drop ou school unless its necesary( i still say you shouldnt) but working can be fun and its not the fact or working im talking more about making the money, im not going to lie i love money but not as much as a bright future. Ill talk a little more abu this on my next blog. Stay in school dailies.
