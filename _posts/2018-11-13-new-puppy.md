Hey Dailies!

My life has been pretty good a little stressful with progress reports coming up this Friday i believe... but other than that
life has been treating me great. Today is Tuesday and so far I'm complaining because I decided to pick up some hours during the
week and now I regret it because I have homework! we all make mistakes. My weekend mmm pretty awesome on Saturday I went out to
breakfast with my family and after that, I took a very nice nap. I woke up from my nap and I got ready for a vigil, once I left
the vigil I arrived at my boyfriend's grandmas birthday dinner which was very family-like, and that was my fun Saturday. On Sunday
it was the best I worked early which isn't so fun but I got off at 12:30 and I watched Christmas movies with my boyfriend and after
that, we went to dinner for my coworkers birthday we went to cheesecake factory (first time there and I loved it). Once we finished 
with dinner we headed to pick up our new member who I absolutely love with all my heart, I got a new puppy her name is Cora (Corita)
everything about my weekend was great I'm so blessed.
