First day in my life!


October 30,2018

   My day was slow like every other day, I did my basic routine of coming to school nothing too interesting happened other than stressing out about math. Math to me is the hardest subjective ever had, it's hard to understand and hard to do the work trust me.i know I am not the only person going through all of this because I see everyone struggling in my 7th-period pre-calc class. Right after school, I got home and there was seriously nothing to eat and as a student, we all know it sucks coming home and there is nothing to eat, it gets me so upset and grumpy. Since there was nothing to eat I made myself some noodles, showered, and did my makeup once I got done with that I rested for a while and did my psychology homework. After a little my boyfriend Luis who I will be mentioning a lot and I've been with for almost 8 months, actually our 8 months is tomorrow November 1st,2018 he picked me up and we went Halloween costume shopping and sadly we didn't find anything we might  just paint our faces or find old costumes, this is actually his first time going trick or treating in so excited!!! That was my day kinda boring and lame but fun. Oh, I also ate some Pho if you guys are interested in trying an amazing pho place and live in Aurora try Top Pho on Colfax. Thank you for spending a daily with Mari :)
