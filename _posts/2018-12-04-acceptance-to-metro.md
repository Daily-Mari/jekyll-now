## My acceptance and major

About a while ago I got accepted to the Metropolitan State University of Denver and I was honestly so happy because it was one of the schools I wanted to attend. Metro is located in one of the places I love which is Downtown Denver I love the city and knowing that I will be attending school there made me super happy. I will be a post-secondary freshman in college in the year 2019. I am pretty nervous but at the same time, i am excited to face the world with higher education. I will be majoring in education and I will get a minor in communications. I want to be an Elementary school teacher and I know Metro will allow me to achieve that goal.

If any of you are interested in attending this amazing school that will help financially please learn more about it and have a campus visit by visiting their page. click
