Hey Dailies!

Guys! I am doing something new today and it involves the holidays yay! So as many of you guys know Christmas is coming our way pretty fast and many of us might not know what to get your girlfriend, boyfriend, parents, siblings, friends, etc. Well, I have
the perfect idea for you, A GIFT BASKET! I will give you ideas of what you could put in that holiday basket. Think winter and coziness... one great thing to put in your DIY gift basket is fuzzy socks they come in so handy trust me. Also be sure to stick
to the theme of the basket if its Christmas stick to red, green, and white colors it would look a lot neater! Put anything that person loves such as their favorite snacks and drinks another thing a person would really like is a good scented candle. Don't
forget to put a Christmas movie in there or gift cards, bath bomb, maybe a blanket, a cozy sweater, perfume or cologne, something the two of you share together, and cute funny quotes or sayings, makeup, soap, pj's, and anything else that pops up in your head. Make sure
to have fun making baskets and if you guys end up designing your own please share pictures with me on any of my social media.
