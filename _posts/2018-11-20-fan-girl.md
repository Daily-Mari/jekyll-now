## Who is Luis Coronel 

I have been a fan of Luis Coronel since 2013. Luis Coronel is a Mexican singer of regional Mexican music, who is 22 years old and started his career at the age of 16 and before that he would post music videos on youtube. Luis Coronel was and still is one of the most successful singers here in the United states his music and popularity grew in less than a year. He has won several awards in Premios Lo nuestro, Premios Juventud, Billboard Latin Music awards, and several others. I can say he is one of the most humble persons out there at least 2 years ago he started his own merch and his own website. Last year he was on tour with Prince Royce!
