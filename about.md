I am an 18 year old who is a senior in high school. Love to give advice and tell people what my day has been like my name is Maribel but friends and family call me Mari. I am the most positive person that has a ton of patience! I have 3 siblings who I will for sure mention a lot and I also have 2 dogs. My favorite people to be around is my boyfriend Luis and my best friend Jennifer. Join my daily days and meet us all ! By the way I am a sagitarrius.
