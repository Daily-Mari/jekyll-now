Hey Dailies!

Downtown... What can you guys say about it? It is absolutely beautiful starting from the building to the people, well what I can say is that I work downtown and I absolutely love it yeah it might be a little difficult getting through the traffic but ill tell you what its the best. I actually never thought that ill be working in Downtown Denver and I love how interesting i could be, one of the things that I love about working Downtown is the people I come across all types of nationalities and I come across people who are different from the outside but at the end of the day we are all the same from the inside. Wait if I haven't mentioned my absolute favorite part is the dogs I see all the time, in our store we actually permit customers to take their dogs in because they are our customers too and omg :( all dogs are the cutest. I would really recommend any of you guys to work downtown, the beautiful nights and the people will really make you fall in love with our world. Although there is a lot of things that are big cons such as how dangerous nights can be because there are crazy people in our world and another thing is seeing homeless people and I don't dislike it in a bad way its just truly heartbreaking that I wish I had a way to help them all but its impossible, whenever you see someone homeless I would encourage you to help that person and give them a big smile because at the end of the smile we helped that person improve at least a little bit.

Hope you enjoyed reading about how much I love downtown!
